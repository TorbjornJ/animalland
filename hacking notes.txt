The font is a 1bpp raw file named vwf.bin. It can be edited in tools such as Tile Layer Pro and Tile Molester. The width of each character is defined in the char_widths table in animalhack.asm.

The "no" symbol (a circle with a slash through it) appears in the font for characters that correspond to control codes; it's useless to put anything there except as an easter egg. (It's possible we didn't find all of 'em, so always check to see if your special character will display.) The same goes for the characters marked with a tiny lowercase "R" for "reserved" -- these are used for text compression. The character $10 in the charset ($90 in the game script) is also a control code for menus, though it's blank, because it also gets displayed (as a space).

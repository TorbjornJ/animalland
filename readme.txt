QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
-------------------
Q: Is there any way to go back to the title screen after choosing "continue"?
A: None that we've found. Reset your MSX.

Q: Can I back out of a command menu when there's no "Cancel" option?
A: Press the 0 key.

Q: This game's too easy!
A: That's not a question. And, well, it is something of a kid's game.

Q: This game's graphics suck!
A: One, that's still not a question. Two, this game was written for the MSX1, on which it is extremely hard to get pretty graphics. The screen is divided into 8x8 tiles, and each line of pixels in those tiles can only have two colors. That means, for example, that drawing an outline around a character or object is just not possible. I'm sure that a particularly skilled artist would be able to create better images, but it would not be easy. Prettier MSX games generally used the much more advanced graphics capabilities of the MSX2.
